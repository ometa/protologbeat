# Protologbeat

## Description

This application is intended as a replacement for [udplogbeat](https://github.com/hartfordfive/udplogbeat). Although quite similar, it does have some improvements and allows you to start up via either UDP or TCP. It can act accept plain-text or JSON logs and also act as a syslog destination replacement.

Ensure that this folder is at the following location:
`${GOPATH}/github.com/harfordfive`

## Getting Started with Protologbeat

### Configuration Options

- `protologbeat.protocol` : Either **tcp** or **udp** (Default: udp)
- `protologbeat.address` : The address on which the process will lisen (Deafult: 127.0.0.1)
- `protologbeat.port` : The port on which the process will listen (Default = 5000)
- `protologbeat.max_message_size` : The maximum accepted message size (Default = 4096)
- `protologbeat.json_mode`: Enable logging of only JSON formated messages (Default = false)
- `protolog.merge_fields_to_root` : When **json_mode** enabled, wether to merge parsed fields to the root level. (Default = false)
- `protologbeat.default_es_log_type`: Elasticsearch type to assign to an event if one isn't specified (Default: protologbeat)
- `protologbeat.enable_syslog_format_only` : Boolean value indicating if only syslog messages should be accepted. (Default = false)
- `protologbeat.enable_gelf` : Boolean value indiciating if process should in mode to only accept [GELF formated messages](http://docs.graylog.org/en/2.2/pages/gelf.html)
- `protologbeat.enable_json_validation` : Boolean value indicating if JSON schema validation should be applied for `json` format messages (Default = false)
- `protologbeat.validate_all_json_types` : When json_mode enabled, indicates if ALL types must have a schema specified. Log entries with types that have no schema will not be published. (Default = false)
- `protologbeat.json_schema` :  A hash consisting of the Elasticsearch type as the key, and the absolute local schema file path as the value.

### Configuration Example

The following are examples of configuration blocks for the `protologbeat` section.  

1. [Configuration](_samples/config1.yml) block for plain-text logging
2. [Configuration](_samples/config2.yml) block that enforces JSON schema only for indicated Elasticsearch types
3. [Configuration](_samples/config4.yml) block that enforces JSON schema for all Elasticsearch types
4. [Configuration](_samples/config3.yml) block for a syslog replacement, with custom ES type of 'myapp'

JSON schemas can be automatically generated from an object here: http://jsonschema.net/.  You can also view the [email_contact](_samples/email_contact.json) and [stock_item](_samples/stock_item.json) schemas as examples.

#### Considerations

- If you intend on using this as a drop-in replacement to logging with Rsyslog, this method will not persist your data to a file on disk. 
- If protologbeat is down for any given reason, messages sent to the configured UDP port will never be processed or sent to your ELK cluster.
- If you need 100% guarantee each message will be delivered at least once, this may not be the best solution for you.  
- If some potential loss of log events is acceptable for you, than this may be a reasonable solution for you.
- This application is intended for scenarios where your application can log to protologbeat running on the same physical host.  It's discouraged to use this for cross-server/cross-region/cross-datacenter logging.
- The current date/time is automatically added to each log entry once it is received by protologbeat.
- Considering this could log data with any type of fields, it's suggested that you add your necessary field names and types to the [protologbeat.template-es2x.json](protologbeat.template-es2x.json) or [protologbeat.template.json](protologbeat.template.json) (*ES 5.x*) index templates.

### Sample Clients

Please see the `_samples/` directory for examples of clients in various languages.


### Requirements

* [Golang](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.7

### Init Project
To get running with Protologbeat and also install the
dependencies, run the following command:

```
make setup
```

It will create a clean git history for each major step. Note that you can always rewrite the history if you wish before pushing your changes.

To push Protologbeat in the git repository, run the following commands:

```
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/harfordfive/protologbeat
git push origin master
```

For further development, check out the [beat developer guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/new-beat.html).

### Build

To build the binary for Protologbeat run the command below. This will generate a binary
in the same directory with the name protologbeat.

```
make
```

If you'd like to build the binary for OSX, Linux and/or Windows, you can run the following:

```
./build-bin [TAG_VERSION]
```

The resulting binaries will be placed in the `bin/` directory


### Run

To run Protologbeat with debugging output enabled, run:

```
./protologbeat -c protologbeat.yml -e -d "*"
```


### Test

To test Protologbeat, run the following command:

```
make testsuite
```

alternatively:
```
make unit-tests
make system-tests
make integration-tests
make coverage-report
```

The test coverage is reported in the folder `./build/coverage/`

### Update

Each beat has a template for the mapping in elasticsearch and a documentation for the fields
which is automatically generated based on `etc/fields.yml`.
To generate etc/protologbeat.template.json and etc/protologbeat.asciidoc

```
make update
```


### Cleanup

To clean  Protologbeat source code, run the following commands:

```
make fmt
make simplify
```

To clean up the build directory and generated artifacts, run:

```
make clean
```


### Clone

To clone Protologbeat from the git repository, run the following commands:

```
mkdir -p ${GOPATH}/github.com/harfordfive
cd ${GOPATH}/github.com/harfordfive
git clone https://github.com/harfordfive/protologbeat
```


For further development, check out the [beat developer guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/current/new-beat.html).

## Running on Docker

You can find the Docker images for this beat [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/hartfordfive/protologbeat/).  Please take note the container starts with a basic config that listens on the default protocol/address/port and accepts plain-text messages.  For any customizations, please modify the sample protologbeat.full.yml config and create your own Docker file that overwrites the original. 


## Packaging

The beat frameworks provides tools to crosscompile and package your beat for different platforms. This requires [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and vendoring as described above. To build packages of your beat, run the following command:

```
make package
```

This will fetch and create all images required for the build process. The hole process to finish can take several minutes.
